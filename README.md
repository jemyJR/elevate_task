# Elevate Task - Flutter App ðŸš€

This is a Flutter application that implements a single screen to display a list of products in a recycler view using the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products). The project follows clean architecture principles and utilizes dependency injection for better structure and maintainability.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Product Listing** : Fetches products from the Fake Store API and displays them in a grid format.
- **Clean Architecture** : The project is structured based on clean code principles with separation of concerns.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: DI is used for better modularity and testability.
- **Shimmer Effect** : A shimmer effect is displayed while the data is being loaded.

### API Integration ðŸ”—

The app fetches data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products) to display a list of products.

### Getting Started ðŸš€

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jemyJR/elevate_task
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Dependencies ðŸ“¦

The app uses the following packages:
- `flutter_screenutil` : For responsive UI design across different screen sizes and pixel densities.
- `shimmer` : For creating a shimmer effect to display while the product data is loading.
- `cached_network_image` : For efficient image loading and caching of product images.
- `dio` : For making API calls and handling HTTP requests to fetch product data from the Fake Store API.
- `get_it` : For managing dependency injection, ensuring modularity and easy testing of components.
- `pretty_dio_logger` : To log network requests and responses in a readable format, useful for debugging.
- `dartz` : Provides functional programming features like `Option` and `Either` for handling results and errors.
- `flutter_bloc` : For state management using Cubit, helping manage and propagate app states efficiently.
